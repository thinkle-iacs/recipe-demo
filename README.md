# Recipe Project

For an overview of how to use GitHub Codespaces, see my
[Sandbox Overview](SandboxOverview.md)

To see your page, open the terminal and type `npm start`.

## Task

Build a one-page recipe website, then use CSS to design how it looks.

Your recipe can be **real** (your grandmother's empanadas, the perfect grilled
cheese, a smoothie you invented) or **metaphorical** ("The Recipe for Becoming
a Great Snowboarder," "How to Cook Up the Perfect Snow Day," "A Recipe for
Surviving Freshman Year").

## Why a Recipe?

Recipes are one of the oldest kinds of structured writing. Every recipe has
the same basic parts — a title, a little introduction, a list of ingredients,
and numbered steps — but if you look at ten cookbooks or food blogs, you'll
see ten completely different designs.

That makes a recipe perfect for learning CSS. You'll write the structure in
HTML, and then use CSS to decide what that structure _looks like_: its colors,
its fonts, and the spacing that makes it easy (and fun) to read.

## A Note on AI

**Important:** While Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Claude.ai can be
useful for tasks like this, their results often lack creativity and feel
lifeless. **DO NOT** use AI to generate your entire webpage or stylesheet for
this assignment — this is considered cheating.

However, you **may** use AI to assist with individual elements, but you must
credit it wherever applicable. For example, if you asked AI to help you come
up with a list of ingredients for a metaphorical recipe, you would need to
include a comment in your code to credit the AI:

```html
<!-- AI-assisted content: ingredient ideas brainstormed with ChatGPT -->
```

## Required Components

### HTML Structure:

- A title for your recipe (`<h1>`)
- A short introduction in paragraphs (`<p>`)
- At least one image (`<img>`) with `alt` text describing it
- An **Ingredients** section (`<h2>`) with an unordered list (`<ul>`)
- An **Instructions** section (`<h2>`) with an ordered list (`<ol>`)
- At least one subheading (`<h3>`) — for example, "For the Sauce" and
  "For the Dough," or "Before You Start"
- At least one extra section of your choice, such as **Tips**, **Serving
  Suggestions**, or **Why This Recipe Works**
- A citations page (`citations.html`, already linked in your footer) crediting any
  images or other sources you used and acknowledging any AI use.

### CSS Design:

Your stylesheet should customize:

- **Color:** A color scheme of at least 3 colors that fits your recipe, with
  text that is easy to read against its background.
- **Fonts:** At least one custom font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/),
  and font sizes that make it clear what is most important on the page.
- **Element selectors:** Rules that change how your elements look
  (for example `h2 { ... }`, `li { ... }`).
- **Classes:** At least one class (for example `.tip` or `.warning`) that
  styles _some_ elements differently from others of the same type.
- **The box model:** `padding`, `margin`, and `border` to group related
  content and give your page room to breathe, plus a `width` or `max-width`
  so your text isn't stretched across the whole screen.

**No layout tools yet!** For this project, your page should flow from top to
bottom. Do not use `display: flex`, `display: grid`, or `position`.
We'll get to those soon. That means you generally won't be able to put items
side-by-side in this project (unless you use `float`).

### Honors Components (in addition to main components):

- Store your color scheme in CSS variables (`--main-color: ...;`) and use
  them throughout your stylesheet. For example:

  ```css
  :root {
    --theme-color: #0033a0;
  }
  h1 {
    color: var(--theme-color);
  }
  ```

- Use a descendant selector (like `ol li` or `.tip p`) to style elements only
  when they are inside something else.
- Customize list markers (bullets and numbers) using `list-style` or `::marker`.
- Use a pseudo-element (`::before` or `::after`) to add a custom marker to at least one item.
- Use a "recipe info" box (prep time, cook time, servings — or the
  metaphorical equivalent) styled with a class.

# Recipe Project Rubric

Grading will happen in two phases:

1. You will get a "Digital Creation" grade based on the quality of your published website.

2. You will get a "Content" grade based on your in-class write-up explaining your code and design decisions.

## Published Website Rubric

Starred items (\*) are for honors students.
